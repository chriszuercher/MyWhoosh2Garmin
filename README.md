<p id="description">Python script to upload MyWhoosh .fit files to Garmin Connect for both MacOS and Windows.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

*   Finds the .fit files from your MyWhoosh installation.
*   Fix the missing power & heart rate averages.
*   Removes the temperature.
*   Create a backup file to a folder you select.
*   Uploads the fixed .fit file to Garmin Connect.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Download myWhoosh2Garmin.py and MyWhoosMonitor.ps1 to your filesystem to a folder or your choosing.</p>

<p>2. Go to the folder where you downloaded the script in a shell.</p>

MacOS: Terminal of your choice. 

Windows: Start > Run > cmd or Start > Run > powershell

<p>3. Run it to set things up.</p>

You can directly call the PowerShell script if you have the required tools installed (see automation tips). This will setup a python venv and install all required packages.

```powershell
.\MyWhooshMonitor.ps1
```

Alternatively you can run the python script (which will install stuff in your local environment)

```
python3 myWhoosh2Garmin.py
or
python myWhoosh2Garmin.py
```

<p>3.1. First it will install Garth and Fit_tool package when you don't have it installed.

```
Installing collected packages: garth
Successfully installed garth-0.4.46
Installing collected packages: fit_tool

```
  
<p>4. Choose your backup folder.</p>

<h2>‚ÑπÔ∏è Automation tips</h2> 

What if you want to automate the whole process:
<h3>MacOS</h3>

PowerShell on MacOS (Verified & works)

You need Powershell

```shell
brew install powershell/tap/powershell
```

Start the script. This will also setup a virtual python environment and starts monitoring the application.

```powershell
.\MyWhooshMonitor.ps1
```

AppleScript (need to test further)

```applescript
-- Define the text file path to store mywhoosh.app's location
set textFilePath to (POSIX path of (path to me)) & "mywhoosh_path.txt"

-- Read the stored path from the text file
set mywhooshPath to ""
try
    set mywhooshPath to do shell script "cat " & quoted form of textFilePath
on error
    set mywhooshPath to ""
end try

-- Check if the stored path is valid
if mywhooshPath is not "" then
    try
        do shell script "test -d " & quoted form of mywhooshPath
    on error
        set mywhooshPath to ""
    end try
end if

-- Search for mywhoosh.app if no valid path is found
if mywhooshPath is "" then
    set mywhooshPath to do shell script "mdfind 'kMDItemFSName == \"mywhoosh.app\"' | head -n 1"
    if mywhooshPath is "" then
        return -- Exit if mywhoosh.app is not found
    end if
    -- Store the path in the text file
    do shell script "echo " & quoted form of mywhooshPath & " > " & quoted form of textFilePath
end if

-- Run mywhoosh.app
tell application "Finder"
    open application file mywhooshPath
end tell

-- Wait for mywhoosh to finish
repeat
    set appRunning to (do shell script "ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -c " & quoted form of "mywhoosh.app") as integer
    if appRunning = 0 then exit repeat
    delay 5
end repeat

-- Run the Python script
do shell script "python3 /path/to/mywhoosh.py"
```

<h3>Windows</h3>

You can simply start the monitor by doubleclick the ```StartMyWooshMonitor.bat``` file which will execute PowerShell with the script.

If you prefer PowerShell you can start the script. This will also setup a virtual python environment and starts monitoring the application.

```powershell
.\MyWhooshMonitor.ps1
```
