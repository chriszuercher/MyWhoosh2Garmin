<h2>‚ÑπÔ∏è Automation tips</h2> 

What if you want to automate the whole process:
<h3>MacOS</h3>

PowerShell on MacOS (Verified & works)

You need Powershell

```shell
brew install powershell/tap/powershell
```

Start the script. This will also setup a virtual python environment and starts monitoring the application.

```powershell
.\MyWhooshMonitor.ps1
```

AppleScript (need to test further)

```applescript
TODO: needs more work
```

<h3>Windows</h3>


You can simply start the monitor by doubleclick the ```StartMyWooshMonitor.bat``` file which will execute PowerShell with the script.

If you prefer PowerShell you can start the script. This will also setup a virtual python environment and starts monitoring the application.

```powershell
.\MyWhooshMonitor.ps1
```
